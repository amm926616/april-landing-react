## 🚀 Task: Implement HeroComponent

### 🛠️ Setup

#### Start from the dev branch:
```bash
git checkout dev
```
#### Set up custom fonts and styles:

    Configure tailwind.config.ts to include consistent fonts and theme styles.

    Example: Add a font family under theme.extend.fontFamily. The styles will be applied to all elements in the components.

    Push the setup updates to the dev branch first. After this, let's go develop the HeroComponent.

#### 🌱 Create feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/hero
```

#### 🎨 Develop

    Implement the HeroComponent UI.

    You can remove any placeholder/template code in the component folder.

    Make sure the design aligns with the overall app style.

#### 💾 Commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement HeroComponent"
git push origin feat/hero
```
